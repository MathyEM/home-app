# home-app

A simple dashboard for my home with Philips Hue light controls, local weather, and calendar and shopping list that syncs with a CALDAV server.
I created a custom REST API to access the Hue API on my bridge and my Nextcloud CALDAV server.

The server is hosted on my Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspbian, with a touchscreen in kiosk mode and an on screen keyboard. See demo video below:
